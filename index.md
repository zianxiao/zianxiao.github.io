## Hello! This is Zian Xiao（肖子安）! 


I am currentlya Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Center for Intelligence Sensor and MEMS within [National University of Singapore](https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/elelc/home.html) and supervised by Prof. Chengkuo Lee. 


During my PhD studies, I focus on design, fabrication, and characterization of high-performance micro/nanodevices on various integrated photonic platforms. My works can be divided into following two parts:

### (Ⅰ) Photonic Integrated Circuits
1. In this paper, a review of the photonic components, functional blocks, and emerging applications for PICs is offered. The common photonic components are classified into several sections, including on-chip light sources, fiber-to-chip couplers, photonic resonators, waveguide-based sensors, on-chip photodetectors, and modulators. The functional blocks of the PICs mentioned in this review are photonic memories and photonic neural networks. Finally, the paper concludes with emerging applications for further study. This work has been published in [Advanced Optical Materials, vol. 11, no. 20, 2301028, 2023](./publication/AOM_23V11_Zian.pdf).


### (Ⅱ) Edge Computing
1. The rapid growth of artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) and cloud computing has led to the generation of massive data that needs to be transferred to the cloud. These massive data include lots of redundancy, which causes high communication bandwidth consumption, high power consumption and high network latency. To address these challenges, edge computing has been demonstrated to transfer some computing tasks from cloud computing centers to edge devices. We naturally combine the photonic sensor and photonic computing core. Such a combination is beyond a simple addition.  The photonic processor can process the complex multimodal sensory information captured by the photonic sensor, for further artificial intelligence tasks. Our photonic edge computing system demonstrates the feasibility of photonic systems, which addresses the huge redundant data communication issue in AIoT systems based on cloud communication framework.This work has been published in [Advanced Science, 2024].
