## Hello! This is Zian Xiao（肖子安）! 


I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Center for Intelligence Sensor and MEMS within theat [National University of Singapore](https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/elelc/home.html) and supervised by Prof. Chengkuo Lee. 


During my PhD studies, I focus on design, fabrication, and characterization of high-performance micro/nanodevices on various integrated photonic platforms and photonic computing. My works can be divided into following two parts:

### (Ⅰ) Photonic Integrated Circuits
1. In this paper, a review of the photonic components, functional blocks, and emerging applications for PICs is offered. The common photonic components are classified into several sections, including on-chip light sources, fiber-to-chip couplers, photonic resonators, waveguide-based sensors, on-chip photodetectors, and modulators. The functional blocks of the PICs mentioned in this review are photonic memories and photonic neural networks. Finally, the paper concludes with emerging applications for further study.. This work has been published in [ Advanced Optical Materials, vol. 11, no. 20, 2301028, 2023.(../publication/AOM_23V11_Zian.pdf)].


### (Ⅱ) Edge Computing
To minimize the mechanical dissipation in micro/nanomechanical resonators, the concept of BIC was applied in the design of optomechanical resonators and, for the first time, the mechanical BICs in optomechanical resonators were experimentally realized and observed.
